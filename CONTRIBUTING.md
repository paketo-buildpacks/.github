The Paketo Buildpacks organization welcomes contributions from everyone.
Formally, contributions are given as pull requests for a given repository. To
contribute to a repository, follow the steps below:

## How do I contribute?

1. Fork the repo you'd like to make a contribution to
1. Clone your fork to your local workstation
1. Create a new branch for the issue
1. Make the necessary changes on that branch
1. Commit and push to that branch
1. Make a pull request against the repo
1. Sign the Contributor Licensing Agreement, if necessary

## Where can I look for issues?

We tag issues that should be reasonable for a new contributor to take on with a
[`good first
issue`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apaketo-buildpacks+org%3Apaketo-community+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)
label so you have somewhere to start.

## Where can I reach out to the team?

- _Want to report concerns/bugs?_ Create an issue on the affected repo.
- _Usage issues/help?_ Reach out to us on [Slack](https://slack.paketo.io/).
- _Want to participate in deeper architectural discussions?_ Attend our weekly
  [working group
  meetings](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/community#working-group-meetings).

## I've been contributing for a while. How do I join the Paketo Buildpacks organization?

The Paketo organization is divided into teams that are responsible for the
maintenance of some subset of repositories belonging to a particular domain
(e.g. Node.js, Python, Golang).

For each team, there are two tiers of participants:

- Contributors
- Maintainers

### How do I become a contributor?

Becoming a contributor requires a history of interaction with repositories
under a given team's jurisdiction (e.g. `node-engine` repo for the Node.js
team).

Once this history has been established, you may self-nominate or be nominated
by an existing contributor or maintainer. Each new contributor must be elected
by a super-majority of the team maintainers.

One way to self-nominate is by creating an issue on the language-family repo
for a given team. You can find an example of a [self-nomination
issue](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ruby/issues/409) on the Ruby
buildpack repository. This nomination included links to contributions made as
justification for nomination and was approved by a super-majority of the team
maintainers.

In order to contribute, you will need to complete CFF Contributor License Agreement.

Start the authorization process by clicking
[here](https://easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) and selecting the
"Cloud Foundry - Series LLCs" option.  If you are contributing code as an
employee of a company click "Corporate", select the appropriate company from
the list, then confirm your affiliation on the page that appears. If you are
contributing as an individual, click "Individual". For further assistance with
EasyCLA, please submit a support request ticket. The [linux-foundation-easycla
bot](https://github.com/apps/linux-foundation-easycla) will automatically check
if you are covered under the CLA when you make a contribution.

The agreement documents that are signed during the above process can be found on the Paketo website:
[Corportate CLA](https://paketo.io/ccla.pdf)
[Individual CLA](https://paketo.io/icla.pdf)

### How do I become a maintainer?

New maintainers must already be contributors, must be nominated by an existing
maintainer, and must be elected by a supermajority of the steering committee.
