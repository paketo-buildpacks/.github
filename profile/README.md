# What are Paketo Buildpacks?

* Buildpacks transform your application source code into container images without using Dockerfiles
* The Paketo open source project provides production-ready buildpacks for the
  most popular languages and frameworks
* Use Paketo Buildpacks to easily build your apps and keep them updated

Watch [this quick demo](https://youtu.be/d_L_AZyocWA) produced by the Cloud Native Buildpacks project to see it in action.

Go to the [**Getting Started**](https://paketo.io/docs/) guides and try it yourself!

# How do Paketo Buildpacks relate to the Cloud Native Buildpacks project?
 
Paketo Buildpacks implement the Buildpack API described in the [Cloud Native Buildpacks Specification](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec). The build and detect phases of Paketo Buildpacks are designed to be run by the [CNB lifecycle](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/lifecycle/)
