# Security Policy

Paketo Buildpacks provides a single point of contact for the reporting of security vulnerabilities in our codebases and coordinates the process of investigating any reports. Please limit notifications to those vulnerabilites that are not already disclosed publicly or belong to software that is owned by Paketo Buildpacks. To notify of vulnerabilites in other software impacting Paketo Buildpacks codebases, please file an issue in the impacted codebase.

**Please do not ever disclose a security vulnerability for the first time in a public forum.**

## Prerequisites

* [ ] Has this security vulnerability been publicly disclosed already?
    - If **Yes**, there's no need to proceed. If you have follow up questions or concerns, you may open a standard bug issue against corresponding project.
    - If **No**, please proceed.

* [ ] Is this a vulnerability in a dependency installed by the buildpack?
    - If **Yes**, then **STOP**, you need to open an issue with the upstream project following their security policy. Paketo Buildpacks will pick up the fix when upstream has made it available.
    - If **No**, please proceed.

* [ ] Is this a vulnerability detected by a scanner against a buildpack build/run image, stack, or buildpack generated image?
    - If **Yes**, then [please read this first](https://paketo.io/docs/concepts/stacks/#when-are-paketo-stacks-updated). If it does not address your concern, please continue.
    - If **No**, please proceed.
